# A "Pipe with liquid" display

Imagine that you have a transparent pipe, and you can put carefully controlled portions of a liquid and air
(or liquids of different color). Thanks to this, it's possible to create various patterns which fully appear after
the sequence of liquid and air reaches its final positions. 

This project is a simulator and a proof of concept of this idea.
